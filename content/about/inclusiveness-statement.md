The ILAS2025 organizing team will adhere to the [Welcoming and
Inclusiveness Statement](https://ilasic.org/inclusiveness-statement/)
of ILAS and make the conference an friendly environment for all.


### Welcoming and Inclusiveness Statement

The International Linear Algebra Society (ILAS) is comprised of a
diverse global membership.

It is the policy of ILAS to offer a welcoming and inclusive
environment to all participants in its activities, including all its
meetings and conferences, regardless of gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, race, color, national or ethnic
origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status,
disabilities, and field of expertise.
 
ILAS strives to foster an atmosphere that encourages the free
expression and exchange of ideas, free from all forms of
discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, and that is welcoming and
safe to all members and to those who participate in its activities.

If you feel harassed or unsafe in any way because of the actions,
words, pictures, or expression of any other member or participant, we
encourage you to bring this to the attention of the organizers, and/or
[ILAS executive
officers](https://ilasic.org/executive-board-emails/). Alternatively,
ILAS has designated three respected former officers, whom you may
contact.
